# EAT DA BURGER


### Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.


* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger in the waiting to be devoured area.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the eaten area.
